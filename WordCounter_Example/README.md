Implement a program that counts occurrences of words in a given file.

The input will have multiple lines, with each line containing one or more words. The output will be each word and how many times it appears. You should print each word and its count on a separate line. The output should sort the words in lexicographically sorted order.

Sample Input
hello world
world hello
hello
howdy

Sample output
hello 3
howdy 1
world 2
